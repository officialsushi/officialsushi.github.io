						<p>The title <em><strong>Section.80</strong></em> is a combination of the name for inner city housing, or “Section 8” housing, as well as the decade that Kendrick was born in, the 1980s. The subject matter ranges from black people’s strife due to the Reagan Administration, women’s issues, drug abuse and conspiracy theories about the government, without sacrificing precise, agile lyricism. The album debuted at number 113 on the Billboard 200, with minimal mainstream media promotion and coverage. As of February 2014, Section.80 has sold 130,000 copies domestically.
